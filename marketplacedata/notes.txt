[Gchat+ only]
This is the same as the free version of Gchat, but gives you the warm fuzzy feeling that you contributed to this app's development. As a tiny perk, you will stay signed in for 24hrs after app launch, instead of the 2hrs of the free version.

[Gchat free only]
This is the free version of Gchat. It's not limited or anything because we love you. However, Gchat+ supports the app's development and servers, and signs you in for 24hrs after app launch, instead of 2hrs.

﻿A beautiful, fast, privacy-conscious client for the Google Talk™ instant messaging service. Gchat supports cool features such as:

- Modern design that integrates with the rest of Windows Phone
- Receive IMs even if the app isn't running with push notifications
- Pin your friends to start and receive tile notifications for each one
- Completely encrypted conversations and support for Google Talk's "off the record" conversations
- New in 1.6: New icon, invisible status, bug fixes, and 24hrs logout timer for Gchat+ users
