[Gchat+ only]
This is the same as the free version of Gchat, but gives you the warm fuzzy feeling that you contributed to this app's development. As a tiny perk, can stay signed in for 24hrs after app launch, instead of the 2hrs of the free version.

﻿A beautiful, fast, privacy-conscious client for the Google Talk™ instant messaging service. Gchat supports cool features such as:

- Modern design that integrates with the rest of Windows Phone
- Receive IMs even if the app isn't running with push notifications
- Pin your friends to start and receive tile notifications for each one
- Completely encrypted conversations and support for Google Talk's "off the record" conversations
- New in 1.5: Loads of bug fixes and 24hrs signed in timeout for the paid version, Gchat+ (please wait up to two weeks for the servers to be updated)
