[Gchat+ only]
This is the same as the free version of Gchat, but gives you the warm fuzzy feeling that you contributed to this app's development. 

﻿A beautiful, fast, privacy-conscious client for the Google Talk™ instant messaging service Gchat supports cool features such as:

- Modern design that integrates with the rest of Windows Phone
- Recieve IMs even if the app isn't running with push notifications
- Pin your friends to start and recieve tile notifications for each one
- Completely encrypted conversations and support for Google Talk's "off the record" conversations
- New in 1.4: Image attachment, alphabetical jumplist, hide contacts, and *bold* and _italic_ formatting
